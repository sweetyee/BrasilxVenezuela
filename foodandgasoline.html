    <h1> Gasoline of Venezuela</h1>
    <p> Venezuela: The price of octane-95 gasoline is 0.84 Venezuelan Bolivar per liter. For comparison, the average price of gasoline in the world for this period is 31.94 Venezuelan Bolivar. The chart below shows the price of gasoline in the country relative to other countries. Use the drop menu to see the prices in gallons. On the graph, the prices for the countries indicated with a * are updated on a weekly basis. The prices for the other countries are updated on a monthly basis because these countries have regulated fuel markets and prices do not change frequently.
      The subsidized price of 0.1 USD on the chart is for the first 120 liters a month only for people with a valid Fatherland Card. Purchases above 120 liters per month are charged at 0.50 USD per liter. Also, the price listed on this page is the official gasoline price. However, during times of fuel shortages in Venezuela, there is a black market for fuel with prices that can exceed substantially the average international price levels. </p>
  
  <h1>Brazil Gasoline prices </h1> 
    The current gasoline price in Brazil is 1.16 USD per liter and was updated on 06-Nov-2023. For comparison, the average price of gasoline in the world is 1.241 USD per liter.</p>
  <p> We have Octane-95 gasoline price data for Brazil from 03-Mar-2014 to 06-Nov-2023.

Our data are obtained from official government sources, regulatory agencies, petroleum companies, and major media sources. We update the series for Brazil every week.</p>
    
 <h1>Food of Venezuela</h1>
  <p> The basic food basket in Venezuela, analyzed for a family of five, had a cost in March of 471.16 dollars, that is, it increased by 46% compared to the same month in 2021, which was worth 322.57 dollars, according to the Center for Documentation and Social Analysis of the Venezuelan Federation of Teachers (Cendas-FVM).

    In addition, the basket increased in price by 3.5% compared to last February, when it cost $454.93, that is, $15.16 per day compared to 15.70 in March.
    
    On the other hand, the average cost of a street lunch for a worker was five dollars, when the food voucher stood at $10.02 per month.
    
    A study conducted by the World Food Programme between July and September 2019 reported that “7.9% of the Venezuelan population (2.3 million) is severely food insecure and an additional 24.4% (7 million) in moderate food insecurity.”
    
    
    
    Last March, the dictatorship of Nicolás Maduro announced an increase in the minimum wage , which currently stands at just over $28 (126 bolivars) per month. That is, with the price of the current basic basket, it takes just over 15 months to eat a month.
    
    With the new salary, Venezuelans still do not reach the figure of $1.90 a day set by the World Bank to consider the way out of extreme poverty by income range.  </p>
  


<h1> Food of Brazil</h1>
<p> The average cost of the basic food basket increased in nine Brazilian cities, according to a November survey by the Inter-Union Department of Statistics and Socioeconomic Studies (Dieese). The biggest hikes were registered in cities in the North and Northeast, such as Recife (8.13%), Salvador (3.76%), João Pessoa (3.62%), Natal (3.25%), Fortaleza (2 .91%), Belém (2.27%) and Aracaju (1.96%). The study took into account prices in 17 capitals.

  The increase was also noticed in Florianópolis (1.40%) and Goiânia (1.33%). The most important reductions occurred in Brasília (-1.88%), Campo Grande (-1.26%) and Rio de Janeiro (-1.22%).
  
  Dieese estimates that the minimum wage necessary to maintain a family in the country should be R$5,969.17, which corresponds to 5.42 times the current national level: R$1,100.00. In October, the value should have been R$5,886.50. </p>
