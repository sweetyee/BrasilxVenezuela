<img src=" https://img.freepik.com/fotos-premium/paisagem-de-angel-falls-na-amazonia_1018896-808.jpg  " alt="">
    <p> Salto del Ángel, in Venezuela, is considered the highest waterfall in the world, with a drop of more than 800
      meters. It was discovered in 1933, when aviator James Angel was flying over the Venezuelan jungle and, since then,
      it has gone from being a secret of the indigenous Pemón people to becoming a true icon of the country. </p>

    <h1>Caracas transport system</h1>

    <p>Let's take a look at the transportation system in Venezuela's capital, Caracas. In Caracas, you will find two
      main means of transport: metro and bus.

      Metro System

      The metro is the most used and fastest means of transport in the city. The Caracas Metro System includes four main
      metro lines, tickets can be purchased directly at the station or can be purchased at newsstands. The ticket price
      is very affordable, you can buy any ticket for less than 0.50$.

      You should avoid traveling by metro during rush hours and can opt for an alternative such as a taxi.

      bus

      You can get anywhere in Caracas by bus. You will easily find buses to anywhere operated by different companies.
      But the difficult and interesting thing about traveling by bus is that the people around you only know Spanish. So
      if you don't know the area and don't speak a little Spanish, it's very difficult to find seats because the bus
      drivers don't know English and the routes are not clearly signposted. When in doubt, ask someone not to get on the
      bus.

      You will have a bus stop anywhere in the city and you can stop the bus from the sidewalk just by waving your hand.
      But remember that buses are more expensive compared to Metro. </p>

    <p> Monthly ticket for public transport $28 </p>

    <h1> Transport in Brazil </h1>

    <p> They bring together the most diverse types of transport, that is, land, water, pipeline and air. However, the
      most used transport in the country, whether for transporting cargo or people, is, without a doubt, road land
      transport, carried out on roads and highways, by vehicles such as cars, buses, trucks, among others.

      The transport sectors in the country have expanded and improved in several aspects in recent decades, which does
      not mean that they are satisfactory. Research by the National Land Transport Agency (ANTT) points to this data,
      with around 60% of transport in Brazil being carried out by highways, 20% by railways, 13% by waterways and 4% by
      airways and pipelines. </p>

    <p> Monthly ticket for public transport R$232 </p>
