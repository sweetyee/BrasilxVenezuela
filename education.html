    <h1> Educational system</h1>

    <p>Public school students typically go to classes in shifts. Some go to school from early in the morning until 1:30
      pm, and others start classes in the early afternoon until 6:00 pm. The school years start in September and go
      until June/July. All students wear uniforms. </p>
<br>
    <h1>Education in Brazil</h1>
    <p>Brazil ranks 53rd in general education among 65 countries evaluated by Pisa. In other words, the country invests
      large amounts of money in including students in schools, facilitating access, but fails to offer quality
      education. </p>


<br>
    <h1> What is the healthcare system like in Venezuela?</h1>
    <p> The Health System is made up of two subsystems: public and private. The National Public Health System (SNPS) is
      made up of institutions linked to the Public Administration whose financing comes from public resources: Ministry
      of Popular Power for Health, the main provider of health services.
    </p>

<br>

    <h1> healthcare of Brazil</h1>
    <p> The Unified Health System (SUS) is one of the largest and most complex public health systems in the world,
      ranging from simple care to assess blood pressure, through Primary Care, to organ transplantation, guaranteeing
      full, universal access and free for the entire population of the country. With its creation, the SUS provided
      universal access to the public health system, without discrimination. Comprehensive health care, and not just
      assistance care, has become a right for all Brazilians, from pregnancy and throughout life, with a focus on health
      with quality of life, aiming at prevention and health promotion. </p>
